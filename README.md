# Braille-Printer
First somewhat big Java project and first portfolio project which will take a file and translate it into braille and eventually print it onto paper.

I am using this a project to confirm my knowledge of the basics and expand my knowledge of Java where I can hopefully:
  1. Use this as a portfolio project.
  2. learn how the software interacts with hardware such as a raspberry pi.
  3. design and 3d print components to actually create the printer and;
  4. use the printer and hopefully share it with people as a low cost alternative to whats out there.

This may be a slow going evolution due to the possibility of travelling for work, continuing on with my coding bootcamp and having to wrangle three kids.
